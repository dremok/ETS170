  <tr><th>Attributes</th><th>Values</th>  </tr>
  <tr>  <td class="name">Specification:  </td><td>Company D wants to develop a smartphone application that you can download from Google Play (for Android phones) that will be called Foorder. This requirements document describes the requirements for the application. The app will be used by customers at restaurants as well as the employees at said restaurant. The mission of the app is to help both the customers and the employees of a restaurant by improving the communication between them and by improving the experience. 
<br><br>
Company D's biggest competitors will be similar systems like Onlinepizza and Mat24 therefore their main competitive advantage will be that they will focus on users being able to have a specific user account where they can save their food preferences and allergies. 
<br><br>
The project is of the type 'sub-contracting' between us and Company D, we will only be making the requirements for the application. Company D will later develop this application and our goal is to help them do this with these requirements.

<H3>Elicitation</H3>

<table class="nodelist">
  <tr><th>Attributes</th><th>Values</th>  </tr>
  <tr>  <td class="name">Specification:  </td><td><h2>Elicitation methods and results</h2>

Before we could start with the specification techniques and before we were able to write requirements for Foorder we made three elicitations, to help us see what product we are writing requirements for and to see which problems that could be solved with this application. The elicitation methods we choose to use was 'Group interview', 'Stakeholder analysis' and 'Prototyping'. 

<h3>Group interview</h3>

This technique was used to elicit what the customers of the project had in mind when they authored their project mission. This technique was used because it was the easiest way to quickly get a grip of what the customers wanted for their product and what they needed for getting the project up and running.

<h3>Stakeholder analysis</h3>

At the time of the stakeholder analysis there were mainly four different stakeholders to this project; company D, restaurant owners of fancy restaurants, waiters and restaurant visitors. 
The most important part of the analysis was to ask the people with domain knowledge, restaurant owners and waiters, what goals, risks, solutions they see with Foorder.
We also asked a couple of restaurant visitors a few questions to see what they wanted and thought about the idea. After receiving this information we had smaller meetings with all the stakeholders and the information we got out of this is available in Appendix 1.

<h3>Prototyping</h3>

To be able to get idéas how to get a good flow in Foorder we made a prototype in paper and then also one with a program called Fluid UI. We wanted to do this so we later on in the process could make design-level requirements. To make sure we were on the same page as our customers we showed them the prototypes and gave them the opportunity to ask questions and give us feedback.

<h3>Results from elicitation</h3>

After the first group interview with company D we reached the conclusion that the system was intended for fancy restaurants and the main stakeholder was the restaurant manager. 
They wanted to make a application where the customers for the restaurants could check in to a table. They also wanted the customers to be able to order food through the app so the waiter would not have to take the order. If the waiter was needed the customer should be able to all for him/her with the app.
The most important part was that the owner should have a good overview of the restaurant and, to give an example, be able to see how long customers had waited for their food and get statistics.
<br><br>
Then we did a stakeholder analysis with people working at restaurants and their guests. The result of this analysis was that the part of the system that the restaurant owner could get an overview of the restaurant was already in place and working without any flaws. 
The people working at the restaurant was not at all interested of the reduced interaction between customer and waiter and said that these features would make their business less gainful.
However there were some features that they thought were really interesting and these features was those that we presented to company D. We asked if they wanted to change the scope of the mission to focus on those features. 
<br><br>
After some compromising we, together with company D, reached the conclusion that the application should not direct to fancier restaurants but more casual and the main stakeholder is now the customer of the restaurant in contrast to the restaurant manager. The product we came up with together should focus on helping people with food preferences to find and order take out food easier.
<br><br>
After the prototype elicitation we come up with a good flow for the new application and we have a good start for starting to make a more realistic prototype to view the design-level requirements.  </td>  </tr>

<H3>Specification</H3>
<p></p>

<div class="entity">
<a id="Specification Specification"><H3><b>Specification: </b><i></i></H3>

<table class="nodelist">
  <tr><th>Attributes</th><th>Values</th>  </tr>
  <tr>  <td class="name">Specification:  </td><td><h2>Specification techniques</h2>

The specification techniques we have chosen to use is "Context diagram", "Feature requirements", "E/R-model", "Task descriptions" and "Screens & prototypes". 
And for our quality requirements we choose "Usability requirements","Performance quality" and "Security requirements". These different techniques will be explained below. 
<br>
<h3>Functional requirements</h3>

<h4>Context diagram</h4>

A context diagram is a diagram over the product and its surroundings showing the scope of the project. It makes it easier to discuss it with a customer what is to be delivered and see the product surroundings. The diagram also makes it easier to verify that there is requirements written to all the interfaces that will be developed. 

<h4>Feature requirements</h4>

Feature requirements is the most common way to specify requirements. These requirements can often be directly translated into functions and is often written in the text form 'The product shall ...'. It is easy to verify feature requirements but it can be quite time-consuming if there are many requirements.

<h4>E/R-model</h4>
An E/R-model is a block diagram that visualizes the data in the system and the relationships between them. It's very useful for developers of the system but can be difficult to understand for users of the system. 

<h4>Task description</h4>
A task description is a structured text that describes a specific user task. It should be easy to understand for both developers and users. A task description is good for specifying different variations of a task.

<h4>Screens & prototypes</h4>

Screens and prototypes is excellent as design-level requirements, but only if they are well tested. Therefore it is important to test the prototype with potential users and see if they can perform all the tasks they are given without any help or assistance. The screens and prototypes technique is also very good to use if, as in our case, the entire system should be developed from scratch.
<br>
<h3>Quality requirements</h3>

You shall also explicitly specify quality requirements, including the benefit of chosen quality level from a user point of view.

<h4>Usability requirements</h4>
These requirements specify how easy the system should be to use.

<h4>Performance quality</h4>
These requirements specify fast the product shall be, e.g. the response time for the different functions in the system.

 <h4>Security requirements</h4>
These requirements specify protection against abuse and unforseen disasters.  </td>  </tr>

<H3>Prioritisation</H3>
<p></p>

<div class="entity">
<a id="Prioritisation Prioritisation"><H3><b>Prioritisation: </b><i></i></H3>

<table class="nodelist">
  <tr><th>Attributes</th><th>Values</th>  </tr>
  <tr>  <td class="name">Specification:  </td><td><h2>Prioritisation method and result</h2>

<p>
Prioritisation is necessary to filter out what requirements that may not be required in the system and how to divide the requirements into different releases. The methods we used for prioritisation is described below.
</p>

<p>
After the initial elicitation with company D all the different features of Foorder were written on small pieces of paper and then sorted into different groups. There were four groups created: “Must have”, “Nice to have”, “Not important” and “Discarded”. After the stakeholder analysis it was concluded that many of the earlier functions could be thrown away, so that is why the “Discarded” group was created.
</p>

<p>
After some further elicitation the scope of the project changed and the prioritisation had to be redone. This time every feature was ranked for importance, both by company D and us. This was weighed together with the estimates of how long the features would take to implement and the result was the release plan.

  <tr><th>Attributes</th><th>Values</th>  </tr>
  <tr>  <td class="name">Specification:  </td><td><p>We choose to use the IEEE standard checklist with a few additions. This checklist is used both internally and by Company D to validate the document. Every requirement should fulfill the following points.</p>
<h4>Correct</h4>

<p>Incorrect requirements are useless and potentially dangerous! If the requirements are not correct, we risk spreading mis-information within project and to customers.</p>
<h4>Complete</h4>

<p>Specification covers all necessary reqs to describe the full scope including exceptions, error handling etc.</p>
<h4>Unambiguous</h4>

<p>Everyone understands it the same way. Can everyone read, discuss and agree on what it means?</p>
<h4>Clear and Concise</h4>

<p>Simply and clearly stated. Makes it easier for others (including pure readers) to understand.</p>
<h4>Consistent</h4>

<p>Are there requirements that contradict each other?</p>
<h4>Modifiable</h4>

<p>Modifications are easy to make, maintaining consistency of the whole specification.</p>
<h4>Verifiable</h4>

<p>If a requirement is not verifiable, determining whether it was correctly implemented is a matter of opinion.</p>
<h4>Design and stability</h4>

<p>Info needed to handle changes; why is requirement important (requirement motivation/ prioritisation / stakeholder), likely to change?</p>
<h4>Traceable</h4>

<p>What motivates this requirement? Indicates if it is needed. Useful when discussing scope and/or requirement changes.</p>  </td>  </tr>

 <h4>Company D</h4>
</p>

<p>
Company D wants the system to be attractive enough to restaurant owners so that they can sell it to the system to them and make money. To ensure that the project is a success and that the system is both what they and their customers want they need to share their input with the people writing the requirements.
</p><p>
Company D pays for the whole development and specification of the system for a great cost. The risk is that restaurant owners don’t want to buy the system and the income of the project is smaller than the cost of the development. Restaurants already have systems similar to Foorder but company D hopes that Foorder will be able to act as an extension to these older system rather than replace them.

 <img src="stakeholder_restaurant_owner.png" style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0; width:7%;"/>
 <h4>Restaurant owner</h4>
</p>

<p>
The restaurant owner who got interviewed emphasized from the start that if there should be an app it should be a common one for all the restaurants and not a custom made for each. He says it would be good if a customer could search for different categories of restaurants in the app. In the application, he wants to have similar information available on the website such as the menu, how to get there and photos of the restaurant.
</p><p>
The restaurant owner says he is absolutely not interested in an application where customers can place an order which is then sent to the restaurant system. He says he would lose on this because then the restaurant would not be able to recommend the food to the customers and he believes that they would more often choose the cheapest dish on the menu.
</p><p></p><p>
When it comes to the booking of tables he was at first not at all interested in this. But after he had talked a while he changed his mind and could see the benefits with a booking system IF it lets the restaurant approve it or write a comment in response. He believes that if a large party books a table at the restaurant at 19.00 and then another large party books at 19:15 he wants to be able to tell them that they may come at 20.00.
So the app would run a kind of reservation system that can easily and seamlessly  first send how many are in your party and suggest what time they will come and then the restaurant will be able to propose a new time, refuse or accept this. The customer should not be able to chose table as it may not be optimal for the restaurant and also the layout can change.
</p><p>
As for the booking he would like to see that there was a way that allows the customer to understand the consequences that they are not so many in the party as they said when they booked or not even show up.
</p><p>
In terms of an overview picture of how long customers have been waiting for, what has been ordered and the like, there is already a cash system which solves this. He sees no reason to replace this system with an app because it solved all the needs that already exists. In this system, you can also see statistics about what is being sold.
He is not interested in ratings of the restaurant or the food in an application because there are very many pages that have this already and it's not all that sets the rating therefore there witll be no meaningful statistics in the end.
</p><p>
He says that he would like to be part of an application that allows customers to order takeaway food from them. Before arriving at the restaurant the customer could order their food and the time that the customer intends to come and get it (he has heard of online pizza but made no use of it). He wishes for some kind of protection if the customer does not show up.
</p><p>
He also mentions an application that automatically updates his inventory system would be good. However, that is more for the suppliers and the app will completely change focus from the "project mission".
</p><p>
He could imagine that it might be good to be able to put offers in the application if he recognises it as a revenue stream.
He points out that the app must be well marketed and there must be many (many!) restaurants interested in the start. He has previously been involved in an application where restaurants could put offers customers could receive. There were very few restaurants that participated in the beginning, and he immediately saw that it would not turn into something and therefore never put up any offers which led to those who developed the app never receiving any money.
He would definitely spend money on an application that is well developed, features many restaurants and puts a lot of focus on marketing.

 <h4>Restaurant staff</h4>
</p>
<p>
After an interview with two waitresses we found out that they themselves couldn’t think of any system/app that would make their work easier.
</p><p>
They mention that they already have a POS system that keeps track of how long the visitors have been waiting and what they have ordered. They did not think that an application where the customers could order through the app would help. Because that would take away a large part of their work and the possibility for customer contact. They also believed that everything was going to be more confused if the customer had ordered what food they wanted before they got to the restaurant.
</p><p>
They state that they really don’t want the customer contact and their ability to provide services to be lost with this application.
</p><p>
They feel like they might think it is a good idea to be able to write down orders through the app and then have the order sent to the kitchen. But only if really works. They fear that if would only makes things more complicated if it’s not done properly.
</p><p>
After some given suggestions and a bit of discussion, they came to the conclusion that a feature that customers could use to order refills on drinks or snacks or just for "calling out" to a waiters would be a great feature. They tell us that when the customer received their food and after their waitress have checked with them that everything tastes good, they then leave the customers alone to enjoy the food. They say that it is often difficult to obtain when they are again needed at the table.
</p><p>
They also said that it would be really great if the customers could give tip with the application after the visit.
</p><p>
After a discussion we also concluded that it would be good if the customer with the app could be able to get answers to which dishes contain lactose or gluten (or other diet preferences). But what they didn’t want was the app to have recommendations on drinks to fit certain food and likewise, because that would take away a big part of their job.

 <h4>Restaurant visitors</h4>
</p><p>
The potential customers and restaurant visitors we spoke to said they would love to have the opportunity to pre-order food and they also said that they wanted to be able to specify the time of the visit if that was possible. They also thought that it would be a good thing to be able to see the ingredients of the different meals in the menu and to sort foods according to different categories such as "chicken", "LCHF" or "lactose-free".
</p><p>
They also liked to be able to reserve a table and be able to see a map of the restaurant in the app. They preferred that the app shouldn’t be designed for a particular restaurant, that it instead should be possible to see a variety of restaurants.
</p><p>
The customers thought that it would have been nice to be able to get recommendations on which drinks is best suitable for a meal and would like to be able to see reviews of the various dishes, and also be able to grade the meal after the visit. And to be able to give comments on the experience.They would in this case also like to be able to see comments and ratings that other customers have set.
</p><p>
They thought that the customer itself should be able to decide whether they want to have an user account on the app or not. If they had an account they thought it would be nice to be able to save their allergies and such so that the menus could be adapted accordingly.
</p><p>
They thought that the feature to be able to "call out" to a waiter/waitress through the app would be useful but only as a complement to the "normal" way.
</p><p>
The customers also thought that it would be fun to be able to save their receipts so that they could remember what they ate. At last they said that a feature to split the order would be very useful.
